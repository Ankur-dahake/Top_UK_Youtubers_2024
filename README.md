# Top_UK_Youtubers_2024

# Objective 

- What is the key pain point? 

The Head of Marketing wants to find out who the top YouTubers are in 2024 to decide on which YouTubers would be best to run marketing campaigns throughout the rest of the year.


- What is the ideal solution? 

To create a dashboard that provides insights into the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their 
- subscriber count
- total views
- total videos, and
- engagement metrics

This will help the marketing team make informed decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with for their marketing campaigns.

## User story 

As the Head of Marketing, I want to use a dashboard that analyses YouTube channel data in the UK . 

This dashboard should allow me to identify the top performing channels based on metrics like subscriber base and average views. 

With this information, I can make more informed decisions about which Youtubers are right to collaborate with, and therefore maximize how effective each marketing campaign is.


# Data source 

- What data is needed to achieve our objective?

We need data on the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their 
- channel names
- total subscribers
- total views
- total videos uploaded




- Where is the data coming from? 
The data is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract), [see here to find it.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-100-social-media-influencers-2024-countrywise?resource=download)


# Stages

- Design
- Developement
- Testing
- Analysis

## Data cleaning 
- What do we expect the clean data to look like? (What should it contain? What contraints should we apply to it?)

The aim is to refine our dataset to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis. 

The cleaned data should meet the following criteria and constraints:

- Only relevant columns should be retained.
- All data types should be appropriate for the contents of each column.
- No column should contain null values, indicating complete data for all records.

Below is a table outlining the constraints on our cleaned dataset:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Number of Rows | 100 |
| Number of Columns | 4 |

And here is a tabular representation of the expected schema for the clean data:

| Column Name | Data Type | Nullable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_name | VARCHAR | NO |
| total_subscribers | INTEGER | NO |
| total_views | INTEGER | NO |
| total_videos | INTEGER | NO |



- What steps are needed to clean and shape the data into the desired format?

1. Remove unnecessary columns by only selecting the ones you need
2. Extract Youtube channel names from the first column
3. Rename columns using aliases







### Transform the data 



```sql
/*
# 1. Select the required columns
# 2. Extract the channel name from the 'NOMBRE' column
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS channel_name,  -- 2.
    total_subscribers,
    total_views,
    total_videos

FROM
    top_uk_youtubers_2024
```
### Create the SQL view 

```sql
/*
# 1. Create a view to store the transformed data
# 2. Cast the extracted channel name as VARCHAR(100)
# 3. Select the required columns from the top_uk_youtubers_2024 SQL table 
*/

-- 1.
CREATE VIEW view_uk_youtubers_2024 AS

-- 2.
SELECT
    CAST(SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS VARCHAR(100)) AS channel_name, -- 2. 
    total_subscribers,
    total_views,
    total_videos

-- 3.
FROM
    top_uk_youtubers_2024

```
## DAX Measures

### 1. Total Subscribers (M)
```sql
Total Subscribers (M) = 
VAR million = 1000000
VAR sumOfSubscribers = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_subscribers])
VAR totalSubscribers = DIVIDE(sumOfSubscribers,million)

RETURN totalSubscribers

```

### 2. Total Views (B)
```sql
Total Views (B) = 
VAR billion = 1000000000
VAR sumOfTotalViews = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_views])
VAR totalViews = ROUND(sumOfTotalViews / billion, 2)

RETURN totalViews

```

### 3. Total Videos
```sql
Total Videos = 
VAR totalVideos = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_videos])

RETURN totalVideos

```

### 4. Average Views Per Video (M)
```sql
Average Views per Video (M) = 
VAR sumOfTotalViews = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_views])
VAR sumOfTotalVideos = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_videos])
VAR  avgViewsPerVideo = DIVIDE(sumOfTotalViews,sumOfTotalVideos, BLANK())
VAR finalAvgViewsPerVideo = DIVIDE(avgViewsPerVideo, 1000000, BLANK())

RETURN finalAvgViewsPerVideo 

```


### 5. Subscriber Engagement Rate
```sql
Subscriber Engagement Rate = 
VAR sumOfTotalSubscribers = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_subscribers])
VAR sumOfTotalVideos = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_videos])
VAR subscriberEngRate = DIVIDE(sumOfTotalSubscribers, sumOfTotalVideos, BLANK())

RETURN subscriberEngRate 

```


### 6. Views per subscriber
```sql
Views Per Subscriber = 
VAR sumOfTotalViews = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_views])
VAR sumOfTotalSubscribers = SUM(view_uk_youtubers_2024[total_subscribers])
VAR viewsPerSubscriber = DIVIDE(sumOfTotalViews, sumOfTotalSubscribers, BLANK())

RETURN viewsPerSubscriber 

```
